Continuous Window Minimizer: Bash Script for Tidying X11 Desktops

The following script is a Bash script designed to continuously minimize all visible windows except the currently active one.

Could be beneficial for several reasons:
Improved Focus: By minimizing all windows except the active one, it helps users maintain focus on their current task without distractions from other open applications or windows.
Enhanced Organization: It automatically keeps the desktop tidy by minimizing unnecessary windows, reducing clutter and making it easier to find and access important information.
Increased Efficiency: Users can quickly switch between applications without manually minimizing or closing windows, saving time and effort.
Customizable: The script allows users to adjust the frequency of window minimization by modifying the sleep duration, providing flexibility to tailor the behavior according to individual preferences.
Accessibility: It can be particularly useful for individuals who frequently work with multiple windows or have limited screen space, as it streamlines the desktop environment for improved accessibility and usability.
